Please read and cite [Reichert et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230507048R/abstract) when you use this reaction network in a publication. 
Furthermore give credit to the data that you are using (reaction rates, thermodynamic conditions, equation of state, etc.). 
For this you can be guided by the example cases that contain the relevant literature in the header of their parameter files in the [par/](par/) folder. 
Additionally, the [Readme](data/README.md) in the [data/](data/) folder contains relevant information about the references of input files. The origin of
the thermodynamic trajectories is given in the list of examples when running
```python makerun.py --example```
or in the Readme of the data folders of the examples (e.g., [Readme](data/Example_data/Example_MRSN_r_process_winteler/README.md)).
