# Example case for a nup-process within a MR-SNe.
# The example trajectory is taken from
# Reichert et al. (2021, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.5733R/abstract)
# and Obergaulinger & Aloy (2017, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.469L..43O/abstract).
# The underlying model of the trajectory is model 35OC-RO, a MR-SNe with
# the magnetic field as inherited from the progenitor of
# Woosley & Heger (2006, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...637..914W/abstract).
#
# * The network includes ~6700 nuclei.
# * The initial composition is calculated via NSE.
# * Reaction rates from the JINA Reaclib database
#   Cyburt et al. (2010, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJS..189..240C/abstract)
#   accessed via https://reaclib.jinaweb.org/ .
# * Neutrino reactions on neutrons and protons are included, neutrino energies
#   and luminosities are taken from the M1 neutrino transport within the simulation.
# * Neutrino reactions on nucleons as in Burrows et al. (2006, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006NuPhA.777..356B/abstract)
#   with weak magnetism and recoil corrections as in 
#   Horowitz et al. (2002, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002PhRvD..65d3001H/abstract).
# * The neutrino reactions on heavier nuclei are taken from
#   Sieverding et al. (2018, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...865..143S/abstract).
# * Temperature and density evolution are taken from the MHD simulation.
# * theoretical weak rates from:
#   Fuller et al. (1985, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985ApJ...293....1F/abstract)
#   Oda et al. (1994, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994ADNDT..56..231O/abstract)
#   Langanke & Martinez-Pinedo (2001, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ADNDT..79....1L/abstract) 
#   Pruet & Fuller (2003, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJS..149..189P/abstract)
#   Suzuki et al. (2016, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...817..163S/abstract).
#   All theoretical weak rates were transformed to the same log<ft> format in case the tables were not 
#   already available in this format.
# * Additional alpha-decays using the Viola-Seaborg formula together with the parametrization of 
#   Dong & Ren (2005, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005EPJA...26...69D/abstract).
# * Electron chemical potentials from Timmes & Arnett (1999, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ApJS..125..277T/abstract),
#   accessed via Cococubed: https://cococubed.com/code_pages/chemical_potential.shtml
# * Beta delayed fission rates from Mumpower et al. (2022, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PhRvC.106f5805M/abstract),
#   neutron-induced fission rates from Panov et al. (2010, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010A%26A...513A..61P/abstract),
#   and spontaneous fission rates that were calculated using the semi-empirical formula of
#   Khuyagbaatar (2020, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020NuPhA100221958K/abstract) together with the fission barriers of
#   MÃ¶ller et al. (2015, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PhRvC..91b4310M/abstract).
# * Fission fragments from Panov et al. (2001, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001NuPhA.688..587P/abstract).
# * Screening corrections from Kravchuk & Yakovlev et al. (2014, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PhRvC..89a5802K/abstract).
# * The extrapolation uses the Timmes EOS from Timmes & Swesty (2000, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJS..126..501T/abstract).
# * no heating
